# Docker - Overview
Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are <b>develop</b>, <b>ship</b> and <b>run</b> anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

## Features of Docker
- Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.
- With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.
- You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.
- Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.
